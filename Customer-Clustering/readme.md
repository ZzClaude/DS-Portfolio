# **Enhancing E-commerce Customer Insights: RFM and K-Means Driven Segmentation**

## **Project Overview**
This project implemented **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** analysis combined with **K-Means clustering** to analyze 540,000+ transactional records, identifying actionable customer insights. The results supported strategic decision-making for **IPO disclosures**, showcasing revenue stability and growth potential. By effectively segmenting customers, we improved retention rates, optimized marketing strategies, and enhanced operational efficiency.

## **Key Objectives**
- **Customer Segmentation**: Categorize customers into meaningful segments using RFM metrics and clustering algorithms to understand behavior and value patterns.
- **Support IPO Disclosures**: Provide insights on customer engagement and revenue trends to strengthen investor confidence.
- **Retention Improvement**: Identify at-risk customers and devise tailored strategies to reduce churn and maximize lifetime value.
- **Marketing Optimization**: Drive personalized, data-driven campaigns to improve engagement and loyalty.

## **Data Analysis and Methodology**
### **1. Data Preparation**
- Utilized **Python** and **SQL** for data processing and analysis.
- **Steps**:
  - Cleaned and preprocessed transactional data (e.g., handling missing values and outliers).
  - Engineered RFM metrics for each customer:
    - **Recency (R)**: Days since the last purchase.
    - **Frequency (F)**: Total number of transactions.
    - **Monetary (M)**: Total spending amount.

### **2. RFM Scoring**
- Standardized RFM values to ensure comparability across metrics.
- Assigned scores to categorize customers based on engagement and value.

### **3. Clustering Techniques**
- **K-Means Clustering**:
  - Determined optimal cluster count using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score.
  - Segmented customers into actionable groups, such as **VIP**, **Frequent Shoppers**, and **At Risk**.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Assessed cluster quality using inertia, Silhouette Score, and Davies-Bouldin Index for meaningful segmentation.

### **4. Result Interpretation**
- Visualized cluster distributions and behavioral patterns to provide actionable insights.
- Collaborated with stakeholders to align segmentation results with IPO-related disclosures.
