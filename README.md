## <big><strong>üìÅ Project Highlights</strong></big>

### üìä Behavior-Driven LTV Modeling for B2B SaaS

> *Built a forward-looking Customer Lifetime Value model for Paylocity based on billing, retention, and product adoption signals.*

- Designed a closed-form DCF model with **personalized retention** and growth rates derived from **XGBoost** and business rules.
- **Engineered behavior features** from billing data to model upsell, cross-sell, and tenure with **strong interpretability**.
- Segmented clients using **k-means++** clustering to support sales planning and customer success prioritization.
- Conducted **sensitivity analysis** and calculated segment-level LTV/CAC ratios for **ROI optimization**.
- Delivered insights directly integrated into Salesforce for **client scoring** and resource allocation.

### <big><strong>üß™ A/B Testing in Mobile Game Design</strong></big>

> *Evaluated user retention and engagement impact of gate relocation in a puzzle game via controlled A/B testing.*

- Ran hypothesis tests (t-test, z-test, bootstrap) on gameplay and retention across 90,000+ players.
- Identified a 5% drop in Day-7 retention after gate delay, advising against rollout despite positive Day-1 metrics.
- Designed AA test to validate randomization and eliminate selection bias.
- Visualized skewed engagement distribution and used statistical correction for outliers.
- Supported product decision-making through rigorous, interpretable experiment results.
